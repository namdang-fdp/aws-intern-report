### 3. Solution Architecture

The platform employs a modern full-stack web architecture designed for scalability, real-time collaboration, and AI integration. The system consists of five major modules working together to provide a comprehensive IELTS learning experience. The infrastructure uses an **active-passive Multi-AZ** deployment on AWS ECS for high availability, where AZ-1 handles all active traffic and AZ-2 serves as a standby for automatic failover.

**System Architecture Overview:**
![System Architecture](/aws-intern-report/images/5-Workshop/AWS-Bandup-Architecture.png)

#### 3.1. Architecture Overview

The IELTS Self-Learning Web System is built on AWS cloud infrastructure with a multi-layered architecture that ensures high availability, scalability, and security. The system follows a microservices-inspired approach with a monolithic backend for core services and serverless architecture for AI-powered features.

**Key Architecture Principles:**

-   **High Availability**: Active-passive Multi-AZ deployment with automatic failover
-   **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with ECS Auto Scaling and serverless Lambda functions
-   **Security**: Multi-layer security with WAF, VPC isolation, and encryption at rest and in transit
-   **Performance**: CDN distribution, caching layers, and optimized database queries
-   **Cost Efficiency**: Serverless AI services, active-passive standby resources, and pay-per-use pricing

#### 3.2. Network Architecture

The network infrastructure is built within a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** spanning two Availability Zones (AZ-1 and AZ-2) for redundancy and high availability.

**VPC Structure:**
